You are my dev assistant. Please wire up Google Calendar sync using the files already in my repo.

Tasks:
1) In the main Express server file (the one that calls `const app = express()`), add:
   import { googleRouter } from '<CORRECT_PATH>/oauth/googleRoutes';
   app.use(googleRouter);
   - If the main file lives in /server, the import path is './oauth/googleRoutes'.
   - If it lives at project root, the path is './server/oauth/googleRoutes'.

2) Ensure a Postgres Pool is created and attached to the Express app:
   import { Pool } from 'pg';
   const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } });
   app.set('db', pool);
   - If a Pool already exists anywhere (used by Drizzle or otherwise), reuse that instance instead of creating a new one.

3) Open migrations/001_calendar_patch.sql and apply it to my database.
   - Use our existing migration tool if available (Drizzle). If not, run the SQL via pg client code or instruct me clearly how to run it in my DB console (Neon/Supabase/etc.) and confirm table/columns exist afterwards:
     - oauth_tokens table
     - task_assignments.calendar_event_id
     - task_assignments.calendar_id

4) In the task + assignment endpoints, call these hooks AFTER the DB writes:
   import {
     onTaskCreatedOrUpdated,
     onTaskDeleted,
     onAssignmentCreated,
     onAssignmentDeleted
   } from '<CORRECT_PATH>/hooks/taskCalendarHooks';

   - After create or update task: await onTaskCreatedOrUpdated(task.id)
   - After delete task: await onTaskDeleted(task.id)
   - After create assignment: await onAssignmentCreated(assignment.id)
   - After delete assignment: await onAssignmentDeleted(assignment.id)

   Find the routes by searching for create/update/delete of tasks and for adding/removing task assignments. Paste the calls in the right places.

5) Add a tiny health route `/debug/google-router` that returns `{ ok: true }` so I can tell the router is mounted.

6) Do NOT hardcode any secrets. Confirm the app reads:
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI
   from environment variables (Replit Secrets).

7) Tell me exactly which file(s) you touched and what lines you changed.
