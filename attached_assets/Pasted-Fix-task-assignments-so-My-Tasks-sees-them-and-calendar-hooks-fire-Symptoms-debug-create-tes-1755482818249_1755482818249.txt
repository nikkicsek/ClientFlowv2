Fix task assignments so "My Tasks" sees them and calendar hooks fire.

Symptoms:
- /debug/create-test-task returns assigneeUserIds with my teamMemberId.
- /debug/my-tasks shows those same tasks but assigneeUserIds is [].
- Therefore the assignment rows aren’t being joined/read correctly.

Do the following:

1) Write assignments with team_member_id
   - In the task creation paths (including /debug/create-test-task and the Projects “Add Task” API), insert into task_assignments using team_member_id (FK to team_members.id). Do not use users.id here.
   - Verify by selecting from task_assignments RIGHT AFTER insert and logging the row(s).

2) Make the reader robust
   - In the storage method used by /debug/my-tasks (and the My Tasks API), build assigneeUserIds with a proper aggregate:
     SELECT t.*,
            COALESCE(json_agg(DISTINCT ta.team_member_id) FILTER (WHERE ta.team_member_id IS NOT NULL), '[]') AS assigneeUserIds
     FROM tasks t
     LEFT JOIN task_assignments ta ON ta.task_id = t.id
     ...
     GROUP BY t.id;
   - Filter “my tasks” by team_member_id:
     WHERE EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM task_assignments ta
       WHERE ta.task_id = t.id
         AND ta.team_member_id = $teamMemberId
     )

3) Backfill any legacy rows
   - If task_assignments has old rows with user_id populated but team_member_id NULL, backfill:
     UPDATE task_assignments ta
     SET team_member_id = tm.id
     FROM team_members tm
     WHERE ta.team_member_id IS NULL
       AND ta.user_id = tm.user_id;
   - Keep user_id for backward-compat, but readers must prefer team_member_id.

4) Calendar hook correctness (idempotent)
   - Hooks must upsert per-assignment using task_assignments.calendar_event_id.
   - On create: if no calendar_event_id -> create and save; on update: update; on unassign: delete & clear.
   - Respect the SYNC toggle.

5) Prove it
   - Call /debug/create-test-task?as=nikki@csekcreative.com → response includes my teamMemberId.
   - Then /debug/my-tasks?as=nikki@csekcreative.com shows that task with assigneeUserIds containing my teamMemberId (not []).
   - With SYNC enabled and tokens present, creating a timed task assigned to me creates exactly one calendar event.

Please implement, restart, and post the touched files.
