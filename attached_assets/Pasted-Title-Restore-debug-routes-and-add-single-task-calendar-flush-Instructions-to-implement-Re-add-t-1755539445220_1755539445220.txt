Title: Restore debug routes and add single-task calendar flush

Instructions to implement:

Re-add these debug routes (GET unless noted) and guard them the same way as before:

/debug/routes – return the list of registered debug endpoints.

/debug/calendar-status – show { hasTokens, keyType, user, tokenInfo.redacted } for session or ?as=.

/debug/calendar-create-test – create a 30-min “Debug Calendar” event for the current user or ?as=.

/debug/my-tasks – return tasks for the current user or ?as=.

/debug/sync/status, POST /debug/sync/enable, POST /debug/sync/disable.

NEW: /debug/sync/flush?taskId=<id> – upsert the Google Calendar event for that single task for every assignee who has tokens.

Keep the ?as=email impersonation working on all of the above.

Acceptance:

/debug/routes lists all endpoints above.

Hitting /debug/calendar-create-test?as=nikki@csekcreative.com drops a small red event on your calendar.

/debug/sync/flush?taskId=<id> creates/updates/deletes the event for that one task.

2) (Next) Make calendar upsert run automatically on task save

Once the debug routes are back, paste this:

Title: Upsert Google Calendar event on task create/update

Instructions to implement:

After create/update of a task:

If due_at exists and the task has assignees:

For each assignee with tokens, upsert a Google event. Store google_event_id per (task_id, assignee_id).

Start = due_at shown in the assignee’s timezone. Duration default 30 min.

On title, due_at, or assignee changes, update existing events; remove events for removed assignees or when due_at is cleared.

Add concise logs so /debug/sync/flush and normal saves report what happened.

Acceptance:

Assigning yourself to a task with a due date+time creates/updates the calendar event within seconds.

Clearing time or unassigning yourself removes the event.

3) Small UI fix you noted (edit from the Tasks tab)

Title: Add Edit action to Tasks tab rows

Instructions:

In the Tasks tab list, add an Edit button per row that opens the same Edit Task modal used in My Tasks.

Pre-fill Description and Assignees; on save, send assigneeTeamMemberIds and persist Description.
