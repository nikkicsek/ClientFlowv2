Fix calendar hooks (not firing on create) and correct due_at computation (double-adding time).

A) Calendar hooks must fire on all create/update/delete paths
1) After inserting a task and its task_assignments, call the calendar hook:
   - onAssignmentCreated(assignment) after each assignment insert
   - onTaskUpdated(taskId) when due_date or due_time changes
   - onAssignmentDeleted(assignmentId) on unassign/delete
2) These hooks must:
   - Respect the SYNC toggle (no-ops when disabled)
   - Be idempotent using task_assignments.calendar_event_id
     • create if null → save returned event id
     • update if present → update that event
     • delete on unassign → delete & clear the id
3) Ensure the hook looks up Google tokens by the **canonical app user id** (users.id for the assignee’s user), not by team_member_id.

B) Fix due_at calculation (currently double-adding time)
1) DB stores due_date (DATE) + due_time (TIME). Do NOT insert into tasks.due_at.
2) In SELECTs, compute due_at once:
   (t.due_date::timestamp
      + COALESCE(t.due_time::interval, interval '00:00')) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'
   AS due_at
   (Keep also returning due_date and due_time.)
3) On the frontend, if you need a local time, convert the UTC due_at in JS using the browser timezone, or have the server also return a `due_at_local` using 'America/Vancouver' for display only.

C) Google event times (no shifts)
- Build event start/end from due_date + due_time in **America/Vancouver**:
  start = { dateTime: `${due_date}T${due_time}:00`, timeZone: 'America/Vancouver' }
  end   = start + defaultDuration (e.g., 30m) with the SAME timeZone
- Do NOT convert to UTC for the Google payload when you provide `timeZone`.

D) Diagnostics
- Log once per hook: action ('create','update','delete'), taskId, assignmentId, had_event_id, result.
- Add GET /debug/sync/logs (last 50) redacting tokens, so we can see if hooks ran.

Acceptance
1) /debug/create-test-task?as=nikki@csekcreative.com → creates a task assigned to me and triggers exactly ONE calendar event (with correct Vancouver time).
2) /debug/my-tasks?as=nikki@… shows the task with a correct due_at (no “double time”).
3) Editing the task time updates the SAME calendar event; unassigning deletes it.
